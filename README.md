# Task-01:  Data Visualization
## Objective:

The objective of this task was to create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## Dataset:
World Bank Population Data:https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

## Description:

This project focuses on visualizing population data from the World Bank to explore the distribution of population growth rates and population sizes across countries. Using Python's pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization, the project provides insights into the demographic trends by creating a histogram to display the distribution of population growth rates between 2022 and 2023, and a bar chart to highlight the top 10 countries with the smallest populations in 2023. This project serves as an illustrative example of how to effectively visualize and interpret large datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.
